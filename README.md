# Project 1: ## Enhancing the Effectiveness of Bank Telemarketing Campaigns Using Data Mining Techniques

# Description: 
The research contribution of this project is divided into three main dimensions. First,
investigate the results obtained when performing five different classification algorithms
(Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN neighbour). The aim is
to build five classifiers and determine the best classifier that has a high ability to predict the
success of telemarketing calls for selling long-term bank deposits. Second, is to choose the
right KPI metric to evaluate the five classifiers. Third, is to enhance the effectiveness of the
bank telemarketing by determining the key

# Conclusion

Our investigation concluded that the Naive Bayes classifier is the best classifier out of five classifiers used in terms of predictive ability. Also, the model did well in classifying the Portuguese retail bank dataset. However, our model still has some weaknesses. For instance, the recall value obtained when using Naïve Bayes is equal to just 47%, which means that the chosen model can detect 47% of potential customers willing to subscribe to the bank long terms deposits while missing the other 53%. Therefore, as future work, more sophisticated machine learning techniques should be considered, such as AdaBoost, Gradient boosting, and GentleBoost, in order to increase the performance of the algorithms and enhance the performance of the Bank Telemarketing
Campaigns.
